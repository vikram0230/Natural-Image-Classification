### This Tensorflow model classifies 8 categories of images 
- Airplane
- Car
- Cat
- Dog
- Flower
- Fruit
- Motorbike
- Person

### Transfer Learning
[InceptionResNetV2](https://keras.io/api/applications/inceptionresnetv2/) is the source network chosen to build the model and the ImageNet dataset is the source domain it has been pre-trained. The model performs classification with an accuracy of 99%.
